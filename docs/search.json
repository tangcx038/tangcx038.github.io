    "text": "Unveiling the true severity of food waste\n\n\nImage by Freepik\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nFood comes from a long journey, starting with the farmer and ending up in our homes. Tradition and good cooking bring us tasty, nourishing, joyful, passionate, and life-giving meals. However, the sad truth is that we throw away a ton of our food—loads of it! And when we do that, we’re also tossing away all the valuable resources that were essential to make it in the first place.\n\n\nWondering how much\n\nfood is wasted across the world?\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organisation of United Nation (FAO), an estimation of all the food produced every year for human consumption in the world, one-third does not reach our stomachs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASTING FOOD IS WASTING AGRICULTURAL LAND. The food produced but wasted globally every year requires 1.4 billion hectares of land, which is close to 30% of the world agricultural land area (UNEP, 2022).\n\n\nWASTING FOOD IS WASTING MONEY. Besides its environmental cost, food wastage also represents a loss of economic value. On a global scale, the economic cost of the overall amount of food wastage is about $US 750 billion, equivalent to the GDP of Switzerland (FAO, 2011).\n\n\nWASTING FOOD IS CONTRIBUTING TO GLOBAL WARMING. The carbon footprint of food wasted globally every year is 3.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. If food waste was a country, it would be the third top emitter after the USA and China (FAO, 2011).(FAO, 2011).\n\n\n\n\nJust take a look at the map below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions from food  across the globe\n\n\n\nLots of greenhouse gas comes from making and eating food. In 2021, the countries causing the most emissions, over a billion tons, are the U.S., Brazil, India, Indonesia, and China. (Crippa, 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChina emerged as the leading contributor, increasing its emissions from 10% to 14% between 2005 and 2015. Brazil and Indonesia reduced their shares to around 7% and 9%, while the U.S. ranged between 7.5% and 10%. The data underscores the complex environmental impact of food systems, emphasizing the necessity for sustainable practices across the entire production and distribution process.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Waste in Singapore\n\n\nImage by Freepik\n\n\n\nWe keep asking the Earth for more stuff, make more things, and end up throwing away a lot. We’re using up natural resources faster than they can come back, especially to make food that doesn’t even get eaten.\nRich countries like Singapore are a part of this. The graph shows more and more food factories in recent years. When we make more food, we also potentially waste more.\n\n\n\n\nZooming into our home country Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph depicting the number of food factories over the years shows a consistent upward trend, notably increasing from 1850 to 1940 in 2020. This suggests a resilient and expanding food industry influenced by economic factors, population growth, and changing consumer preferences. The successive yearly increments highlight a sustained positive trajectory, with 2020 experiencing a substantial rise possibly due to increased demand. However, this growth raises concerns about potential food surplus and waste as production may outpace demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a considerable amount of food waste being generated, the visualization exposes a concerning trend where a substantial portion is not being effectively recycled. Instead, a high volume of food is disposed of, contributing to environmental concerns. The interactive features of the chart empower users to delve into the intricate details of waste management by exploring and selecting various materials. This exploration unveils the distinct quantities of each material being generated, disposed of, and recycled in Singapore, shedding light on the urgency of addressing food waste management practices for a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResourceful Waste by Recycling\n\n\nImage by Freepik\n\n\n\nImagine the transformative power of a collective commitment to recycling. Let’s delve into Singapore’s recycling and waste rates, envisioning a future where each small act of recycling contributes to a monumental impact.\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we start recycling?\n\n\n\n\nThe Shiny interactive chart provides a comprehensive visualization of wasting and recycling rates for various types of waste. Notably, the lines representing the rates for food and plastics reveal a concerning trend. This lack of intersection indicates that concerted efforts to recycle these common types of waste, namely food and plastics, are currently insufficient. The implications are significant, as effective recycling of these materials could have a substantial positive impact on waste management and environmental sustainability.\n\n\n\nTurning Waste into Energy: NUS Researchers Leading the Charge\n\n\nAre you aware of Singapore’s food waste challenges? NUS researchers, under the guidance of Associate Professor Tong Yen Wah, are tackling this issue head-on. Approximately 10% of total waste in the country is attributed to discarded food, and the recycling rate hovers around 14%. But here’s the exciting part:\n\n\nCan waste be transformed into a sustainable cycle? In collaboration with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, the team has developed an innovative anaerobic digester system. This groundbreaking technology efficiently converts food scraps into a self-sustaining cycle of electrical energy, heat, and fertilizers.\n\n\nHave you heard of a biochemical stomach for waste? Operating like just that, the anaerobic digester, designed by Dr. Zhang Jingxin, breaks down organic matter in an oxygen-free environment. It generates biogas, which is then transformed into heat and electricity, powering the entire process.\n\n\nHow much electricity can one tonne of food waste produce? According to the team’s estimates, it can generate between 200 to 400 kilowatt-hours. Additionally, the anaerobic digester yields nutrient-rich digestate, converting about 80% of fed food waste. This byproduct can be further processed into liquid fertilizers, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEver wondered about the untapped energy potential in recycling? The donut chart above not only visually represents potential energy savings but also delves into the world of waste, including food waste. The concentric circles guide you through the proportional distribution of energy savings, offering a look at the contributions of various waste types. Have you considered the impact of recycling on energy conservation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter graph provides a comprehensive perspective on the potential energy savings associated with recycling various types of waste, extending beyond food waste. It highlights the broader impact of recycling, emphasizing the significance of considering diverse materials, such as paper, in our efforts to conserve energy. The placement of data points across the graph effectively communicates the energy-saving potential of different waste materials. The visual representation serves as a compelling reminder that materials often disposed of without much thought, including paper, have substantial contributions to energy conservation when recycled. This graph underscores the importance of holistic waste management practices, encouraging a mindful approach to recycling various materials to maximize overall energy savings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph indicates a strong relationship between a country’s population size and its total food waste, with an r^2 regression coefficient of approximately 0.966. This implies that 96.6% of the variability in a nation’s overall food waste can be accounted for by its population size. These results align precisely with my hypothesis that a country’s total food waste is influenced by its population size.\nTo conclude, if every individual takes responsibility and contributes to reducing food waste through recycling and mindful consumption, we have the power to make a significant impact.\nBy doing so, not only can we decrease the amount of food discarded, but we can also save substantial amounts of energy.\n\n\n🌿It’s a collective effort that holds the key to a more sustainable and energy-efficient future for our planet.🌿"
