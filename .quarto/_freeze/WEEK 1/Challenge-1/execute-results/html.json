I am excited about the prospect of combining architectural design principles with interactive and user-friendly web interfaces.\n\nI am looking forward to the learning journey and gaining insights from fellow enthusiasts and experts. Let's embark on this exciting adventure together! :)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Curious how I created this?\n\nHere's how I did it:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Image 2: Using R Markdown and writing those code](Screenshot14-08-23.png){width=1800px height=500px}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Image 3: Using R Markdown and writing those code](Screenshot(2)14-08-23.png){width=1800px height=500px}\n:::\n:::\n\nand using similar code, I input this image:P\n\nSo coding can be more fun than it looks!! Excited and definitely looking forward to make my webpage even more fabulous!\n\n---\n\n## Notes about NM2207\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n{r, out.height= \"350px\",out.width= \"800px\",echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,fig.cap=\"Replace text here with the caption\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"insert_path_to_your_file_here\") \n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the snippet above,\n\n--> {r} is required to indicate to that whatever is enclosed within the three back-ticks are commands.\n\n--> out.height and out.width are used to adjust the size of the figure, try changing the numbers and see what happens.\n\n--> echo=*TRUE* makes sure that the commands are printed in the output document. If echo=*FALSE*, \"Replace text here with the caption\" will not be appearing.  \n\n--> an alternative way to insert image: image into the default Working Folder, and \"--.png/jpg\"\n\n--> eval=TRUE makes sure that commands are executed and that the results are printed, meaning the image will appear. If eval=*FALSE*, meaning earlier evaluation is *FALSE* and image will not appear.\n\n\n---\n## R Markdown\n\nThis is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     speed           dist       \n Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n## Including Plots\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Challenge-1_files/figure-html/pressure-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
