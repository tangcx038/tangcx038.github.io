::: {#about-block}
:::

I am a undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, currently in my third year studying Architecture. My passion lies in design and creativity. While my primary focus has been on architectural concepts and aesthetics, I am also enthusiastic about expanding my skill set to include coding and web development.

My goal is to acquire coding skills that will empower me to design and develop my own webpage. I am thrilled about the prospect of merging architectural design principles with interactive and user-friendly web interfaces.

Explore my website to discover more! Don't hesitate to reach out if you have opportunities for internships, learning experiences in webpage development, or positions in architecture firms, art studios, or any design-related fields. I'm eager to discuss potential collaborations and opportunities, and my [inbox](mailto:e0775098@u.nus.edu) is always open for exciting ventures in these domains.
