This journey, called the supply chain, uses a lot of the Earth's resources. When we sit down to eat, we get to enjoy the amazing result. Tradition and good cooking bring us tasty, nourishing, joyful, passionate, and life-giving meals. However, the sad truth is that we throw away a ton of our food—loads of it! And when we do that, we're also tossing away all the valuable resources that were essential to make it in the first place.</p>\n\n  <p>**WASTING FOOD IS WASTING AGRICULTURAL LAND.** The food produced but wasted globally every year requires 1.4 billion hectares of land, which is close to 30% of the world agricultural land area (UNEP, 2022).</p>\n\n  <p>**WASTING FOOD IS CONTRIBUTING TO GLOBAL WARMING.** The carbon footprint of food wasted globally every year is 3.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. If food waste was a country, it would be the third top emitter after the USA and China (FAO, 2011).</p>\n\n  <p>**WASTING FOOD IS WASTING MONEY.** Besides its environmental cost, food wastage also represents a loss of economic value. On a global scale, the economic cost of the overall amount of food wastage is about $US 750 billion, equivalent to the GDP of Switzerland (FAO, 2011).</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"\" class=\"text-center fw-bold my-5\">Wondering how much <div class=\"foodwasteword\">food is wasted across the world?</div></h3>\n  <p>According to the **United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organisation of United Nation (FAO)**, an estimation of all the food produced every year for human consumption in the world, one-third does not reach our stomachs.</p>\n</section>\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<section class=\"image-container\">\n  <img src=\"tasty-food-arrangement-top-view.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;height:300px;object-fit:cover;\"/>\n  <h5 class=\"center-text-bg-img\">Food in Singapore</h5>\n  <p class=\"bottom-right-text-bg-img\">Image by [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/tasty-food-arrangement-top-view_20552615.htm#query=food%20packages&position=23&from_view=search&track=ais&uuid=93342a26-4a2a-4889-a4e0-fad38046c4af)</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"Zooming into our home country\" class=\"container\" width=\"100%\">\n  <h3 class=\"text-center fw-bold my-5\">Singapore</h3>\n  <p>With increasing number of **food factories**, the number of food waste **increases**.</p>\n</section>\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nemissions_from_food <- read_csv(\"emissions-from-food.csv\")\n\nworld_emissions_map <- emissions_from_food %>% \n  filter(country != \"World\") %>% \n  left_join(world_map, by = c(\"country\" = \"region\"))\n\nmap <- world_emissions_map %>% \n  filter(Year == 2015) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n  geom_polygon_interactive(aes(fill = `Food emissions by country`, \n                               text = paste(\"Country: \", country, \"<br>Food Emissions: \", `Food emissions by country`)), \n                           color = \"black\", size = 0.2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Greenhouse gas emissions from food systems, 2015\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_binned(low = \"darkseagreen1\", high = \"seagreen\", \n                    breaks = c(10000000, 50000000, 100000000, 500000000, 1000000000),\n                    label = c(\"10 million t\", \"50 million t\", \"100 million t\", \"500 million t\", \"1 billion t\"),\n                    guide = guide_colorsteps(barheight = unit(0.1, \"in\"), barwidth = unit(6, \"in\"))) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(color = \"gray20\", family = \"serif\", size = 20),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.title = element_blank()\n  ) \n\n# Convert ggplot to plotly\nmap <- ggplotly(map)\n\n# Add a caption\nmap <- map %>% layout(annotations = list(text = \"Source: Crippa et al.
