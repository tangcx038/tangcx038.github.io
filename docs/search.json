While my main focus has been on architectural concepts and aesthetics, I am also eager to expand my skill set to include coding and web development.\nMy goal is to learn coding skills that will enable me to design and develop my own webpage. I am excited about the prospect of combining architectural design principles with interactive and user-friendly web interfaces.\nI am looking forward to the learning journey and gaining insights from fellow enthusiasts and experts. Letâ€™s embark on this exciting adventure together! :)"
