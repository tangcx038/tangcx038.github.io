Questions\n\n#### Question 1: Emoji Expressions\n\nImagine you're analyzing social media posts for sentiment analysis. If you were to create a variable named \"postSentiment\" to store the sentiment of a post using emojis (üòÑ for positive, üòê for neutral, üò¢ for negative), what data type would you assign to this variable? Why? (_narrative type question, no code required_)\n\n**Solution:**  Since the emojis represent positive, neutral and negative, they represents catergories with order, thus they are ordinal categoric data which are normally character. Since we are using \"postSentiment\", it would likely to be assigned the data type of \"string\".\n\n\n#### Question 2: Hashtag Havoc\n\nIn a study on trending hashtags, you want to store the list of hashtags associated with a post. What data type would you choose for the variable \"postHashtags\"? How might this data type help you analyze and categorize the hashtags later? (_narrative type question, no code required_)\n\n**Solution:**  postHashtags would likely to be datatype \"list\" or character string. Element in a list can be named and list are useful for storing hashtags since they can vary in number and their order of appearance may be important. Therefore, with list, one can categories the data based on criteria and iterate through the list, tally up the occurrence of each hashtag and identify trends and patterns.\n\n\n#### Question 3: Time Traveler's Log\n  \nYou're examining the timing of user interactions on a website. Would you use a numeric or non-numeric data type to represent the timestamp of each interaction? Explain your choice (_narrative type question, no code required_)\n\n**Solution:** I would use non-numeric data type since \"-\",month=\"april\",2.2.2023 all these would be classified as string and continuous double therefore non-numeric. \n\n\n#### Question 4: Event Elegance\n\nYou're managing an event database that includes the date and time of each session. What data type(s) would you use to represent the session date and time? (_narrative type question, no code required_)\n\n**Solution:**  I would use a continuous numeric datatype because time and date are numerical values, it is continuous and has order of progression of time. Using numeric datatype, one will be able to store and manipulate time-related data easily.\n\n#### Question 5: Nominee Nominations\nYou're analyzing nominations for an online award. Each participant can nominate multiple candidates. What data type would be suitable for storing the list of nominated candidates for each participant?  (_narrative type question, no code required_)\n\n**Solution:**  Since each participants can nominate multiple candidates,  using list data type can elicit names in the list, retrieve the element specifically named and truncated list. \n\n\n#### Question 6: Communication Channels\nIn a survey about preferred communication channels, respondents choose from options like \"email,\" \"phone,\" or \"social media.\" What data type would you assign to the variable \"preferredChannel\"? (_narrative type question, no code required_)\n\n**Solution:** I woudl assign categoric data type for \"preferredChannel\" since categorical dat type is used to represent data that has distinct categories without any inherent order. Since \"email\",\"phone\", \"social media\" are discrete, \"preferredChannel\" variable is suitable because it accurately reflects the data without implying any sort of numeric relationship.\n\n#### Question 7: Colorful Commentary\n\nIn a design feedback survey, participants are asked to describe their feelings about a website using color names (e.g., \"warm red,\" \"cool blue\"). What data type would you choose for the variable \"feedbackColor\"? (_narrative type question, no code required_)\n\n**Solution:**  Since the color names are \"red\" and \"blue\", they are Categoric variables and they are nominal as they do not have natural ordering. Therefore their type is character or logical. But in this case, it should be string of characters. \n\n#### Question 8: Variable Exploration\n\nImagine you're conducting a study on social media usage. Identify three variables related to this study, and specify their data types in R. Classify each variable as either numeric or non-numeric.\n\n**Solution:**   \nVariable 1: Number of followers\nData type: Numeric (integer; whole number)\n\nVariable 2: Time spent on social media\nData type: Numeric (Double; decimal values)\n\nVariable 3: Favourite social media platform\nData type: Catgoric character (String; non-numeric)\n\n#### Question 9: Vector Variety\n\nCreate a numeric vector named \"ages\" containing the ages of five people: 25, 30, 22, 28, and 33. Print the vector.\n\n**Solution:** \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nages<- c(25L,30L,22L,28L,33L)\nprint(ages)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 25 30 22 28 33\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Question 10: List Logic\n\nConstruct a list named \"student_info\" that contains the following elements:\n\n  - A character vector of student names: \"Alice,\" \"Bob,\" \"Catherine\"\n\n  - A numeric vector of their respective scores: 85, 92, 78\n\n  - A logical vector indicating if they passed the exam: TRUE, TRUE, FALSE\n\nPrint the list.\n\n**Solution:** \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstudent_info<-list (name=c(\"Alice\",\"Bob\",\"Catherine\"), scores=c(85,92,78),passed_exam=c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE))\nprint(student_info)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n$name\n[1] \"Alice\"     \"Bob\"       \"Catherine\"\n\n$scores\n[1] 85 92 78\n\n$passed_exam\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Question 11: Type Tracking\n\nYou have a vector \"data\" containing the values 10, 15.5, \"20\", and TRUE. Determine the data types of each element using the typeof() function.\n\n**Solution:** \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create a vector\nx <- c(10,15.5,\"20\",TRUE)\n# Check the type of x\ntypeof(x[1])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(x[2])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(x[3])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(x[4])\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Question 12: Coercion Chronicles\n\nYou have a numeric vector \"prices\" with values 20.5, 15, and \"25\". Use explicit coercion to convert the last element to a numeric data type. Print the updated vector.\n\n**Solution:** \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprices <- c(20.5, 15, \"25\")\n\n# Convert the last element to a numeric data type\nprices[3] <- as.numeric(prices[3])\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Question 13: Implicit Intuition\n\nCombine the numeric vector c(5, 10, 15) with the character vector c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"). What happens to the data types of the combined vector? Explain the concept of implicit coercion.\n\n**Solution:** \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnumeric_vector <- c(5, 10, 15)\ncharacter_vector <- c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\ncombined_vector <- c(numeric_vector, character_vector)\n\nprint(combined_vector)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"5\"      \"10\"     \"15\"     \"apple\"  \"banana\" \"cherry\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(typeof(combined_vector))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe data types of the combined vector will be implicitly coerced to a common data type. In this case, the resulting vector will be a characater data type due to the presence of character vector, hence R convert the numeric data type to character data type based on its content.\n\n\n#### Question 14: Coercion Challenges\n\nYou have a vector \"numbers\" with values 7, 12.5, and \"15.7\". Calculate the sum of these numbers. Will R automatically handle the data type conversion? If not, how would you handle it?\n\n**Solution:** \nMixing different data types (numeric and character) in arithmetic operations, R will not automatically handle the data type conversion. Since R will not be able to automatically handle the data type conversion, I need to use explicit coercion to convert the character into numeric using as.numeric.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n numbers <- c(7, 12.5, \"15.7\")\n\n# Convert character elements to numeric\nnumbers <- as.numeric(numbers)\n\n# Calculate the sum\nsum_result <- sum(numbers)\n\n#simplify \n#sum(as.numeric(numbers))\n\nprint(sum_result)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 35.2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Question 15: Coercion Consequences\n\nSuppose you want to calculate the average of a vector \"grades\" with values 85, 90.5, and \"75.2\". If you directly calculate the mean using the mean() function, what result do you expect? How might you ensure accurate calculation?\n\n**Solution:** \nIf I directly calculate the mean of the vector \"grades\" with values 85, 90.5, and \"75.2\" using the mean() function without any data type conversion,can lead to incorrect results such as 85. \nAs shown here,\nmean(85,90.5,\"75.2\")\n[1] 85 OR\ngrades <- c(85, 90.5, \"75.2\")\nmean(grades)\n[1] NA\nMean() function requires the input vector to contain only numeric values.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngrades <- c(85, 90.5, \"75.2\")\n\n# Convert character element to numeric\ngrades <- as.numeric(grades)\n\n# Calculate the mean\nmean_result <- mean(grades)\n\n# Simplify\n#mean_result <- mean(as.numeric(grades))\nprint(mean_result)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 83.56667\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Question 16: Data Diversity in Lists\n\nCreate a list named \"mixed_data\" with the following components:\n\n  - A numeric vector: 10, 20, 30\n  \n  - A character vector: \"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"\n\n  - A logical vector: TRUE, FALSE, TRUE\n  \nCalculate the mean of the numeric vector within the list.\n\n**Solution:** \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Creating the list with different components\nmixed_data <- list(numeric_vector = c(10, 20, 30),character_vector = c(\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"),logical_vector = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))\n\n# Calculate the mean of the numeric vector within the list\nmean_numeric <- mean(mixed_data$numeric_vector)\n#Another way to calculate the mean of the numeric vector within the list\n#mean_numeric <- mean(mixed_data[[\"numeric_vector\"]])\nprint(mean_numeric)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 20\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Question 17: List Logic Follow-up\n\nUsing the \"student_info\" list from Question 10, extract and print the score of the student named \"Bob.\"\n\n**Solution:** \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Assuming you have the \"student_info\" list defined from Question 10\nstudent_info<-list(names = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Catherine\"),scores = c(85, 92, 78),passed_exam = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE))\n\n# Extract and print the score of the student named \"Bob\"\nbob_score<-student_info$scores[student_info$names == \"Bob\"]\n\nprint(bob_score)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 92\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Question 18: Dynamic Access\n\nCreate a numeric vector values with random values.
