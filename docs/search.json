    "text": "Unveiling the true severity of food waste\n\n\nImage by Freepik\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nFood comes from a long journey, starting with the farmer and ending up in our homes. This journey, called the supply chain, uses a lot of the Earth’s resources. When we sit down to eat, we get to enjoy the amazing result. Tradition and good cooking bring us tasty, nourishing, joyful, passionate, and life-giving meals. However, the sad truth is that we throw away a ton of our food—loads of it! And when we do that, we’re also tossing away all the valuable resources that were essential to make it in the first place.\n\n\nWASTING FOOD IS WASTING AGRICULTURAL LAND. The food produced but wasted globally every year requires 1.4 billion hectares of land, which is close to 30% of the world agricultural land area (UNEP, 2022).\n\n\nWASTING FOOD IS WASTING MONEY. Besides its environmental cost, food wastage also represents a loss of economic value. On a global scale, the economic cost of the overall amount of food wastage is about $US 750 billion, equivalent to the GDP of Switzerland (FAO, 2011).\n\n\nWondering how much\n\nfood is wasted across the world?\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organisation of United Nation (FAO), an estimation of all the food produced every year for human consumption in the world, one-third does not reach our stomachs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWASTING FOOD IS CONTRIBUTING TO  GLOBAL WARMING\n\n\n\nThe carbon footprint of food wasted globally every year is 3.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. If food waste was a country, it would be the third top emitter after the USA and China (FAO, 2011).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map tells us about how much greenhouse gas comes from making and eating food in different countries. In 2021, the countries causing the most emissions, over a billion tons, are the U.S., Brazil, India, Indonesia, and China. These are the same countries that were on the list from 1990 to 2021 for having the most greenhouse gas emissions from their food systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart provides insights into how food production affects the environment, specifically focusing on greenhouse gas emissions. It illustrates the percentage of a country’s emissions from food systems in comparison to the global total from 1990 to 2015. China’s emissions steadily increased during this period, rising from 10% to 14%, making it the top contributor from 2005 to 2015. Brazil and Indonesia experienced fluctuations but ultimately reduced their shares to around 7% and 9% in 2015. The U.S. contributed between 7.5% and 10%, while India saw a slight increase from 5% to 6%. Argentina maintained a consistent 2%, and Mexico had the smallest share at around 1%. The graph highlights the intricate environmental impact of food systems, involving various activities from farming and land use changes to the entire supply chain, including transportation, packaging, processing, retail, cooking, and waste management. Importantly, these figures focus on emissions tied to food production, emphasizing the need for sustainable practices throughout the entire food production and distribution process to address their environmental impact.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood Waste in Singapore\n\n\nImage by Freepik\n\n\n\nWe keep asking the Earth for more stuff, make more things, and end up throwing away a lot. We’re using up natural resources faster than they can come back, especially to make food that doesn’t even get eaten.\nRich countries like Singapore are a part of this. The graph shows more and more food factories in recent years. When we make more food, we also potentially waste more.\n\n\n\n\nZooming into our home country Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph depicting the number of food factories across the years reveals a consistent upward trend, with a notable increase in 2020 from 1850 to 1940, marking a positive growth pattern. This steady expansion may be indicative of a resilient and growing food industry, potentially influenced by economic factors, population growth, and shifting consumer preferences. The successive yearly increments, such as in 2019 (1850 factories), 2018 (1802), 2017 (1755), and 2016 (1678), underscore a sustained positive trajectory. The substantial rise in 2020 could be linked to increased demand. However, this growth also raises considerations about the potential for food surplus and waste as increased production may outpace demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shiny interactive chart vividly illustrates the significant impact of food waste as a substantial contributor to overall waste in Singapore. With a considerable amount of food waste being generated, the visualization exposes a concerning trend where a substantial portion is not being effectively recycled. Instead, a high volume of food is disposed of, contributing to environmental concerns. The interactive features of the chart empower users to delve into the intricate details of waste management by exploring and selecting various materials. This exploration unveils the distinct quantities of each material being generated, disposed of, and recycled in Singapore, shedding light on the urgency of addressing food waste management practices for a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future.\n\n\n\n\n\nResourceful Waste by Recycling\n\n\nImage by Freepik\n\n\n\nImagine the transformative power of a collective commitment to recycling. Let’s delve into Singapore’s recycling and waste rates, envisioning a future where each small act of recycling contributes to a monumental impact.\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we start recycling?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Shiny interactive chart provides a comprehensive visualization of wasting and recycling rates for various types of waste. Notably, the lines representing the rates for food and plastics reveal a concerning trend—they do not intersect. This lack of intersection indicates that concerted efforts to recycle these common types of waste, namely food and plastics, are currently insufficient. The implications are significant, as effective recycling of these materials could have a substantial positive impact on waste management and environmental sustainability.\n\n\n\n\nA bit of information regarding this segment: NUS researchers are at the forefront of addressing Singapore’s food waste challenges, with approximately 10% of total waste attributed to discarded food and a recycling rate of around 14%. Headed by Associate Professor Tong Yen Wah from NUS Faculty of Engineering’s Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, a collaboration with Shanghai Jiao Tong University has led to the development of an innovative anaerobic digester system. This system efficiently converts food scraps into electrical energy, heat, and fertilizers, forming a self-sustaining cycle as the generated electricity and heat power the entire process.\nOperating like a biochemical stomach, the anaerobic digester breaks down organic matter in an oxygen-free environment. Designed by Dr. Zhang Jingxin from NUS Environmental Research Institute (NERI), the system utilizes anaerobic micro-organisms to convert food waste into biogas, subsequently transformed into heat and electrical energy. The repurposed heat is used to produce hot water, maintaining the optimal temperature for digestion. Every component of the system, from sensors to ventilating fans, is powered by electricity generated within.\nAccording to the team’s calculations, one tonne of food waste can generate between 200 to 400 kilowatt-hours of electricity, contingent on waste composition. The anaerobic digester also yields nutrient-rich digestate, converting about 80% of fed food waste, which can be further processed into liquid fertilizers for agricultural use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe donut chart visually represents the potential energy savings achievable through recycling various waste types, encompassing food waste. The concentric circles illustrate the proportionate distribution of energy savings, with each segment representing a specific waste category. This insightful visualization provides a clear overview of the comparative contributions of different waste types to the overall potential energy conservation. Specifically, the chart emphasizes the significant role of recycling, including the recycling of food waste, in harnessing and optimizing energy resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter graph provides a comprehensive perspective on the potential energy savings associated with recycling various types of waste, extending beyond food waste. It highlights the broader impact of recycling, emphasizing the significance of considering diverse materials, such as paper, in our efforts to conserve energy. The placement of data points across the graph effectively communicates the energy-saving potential of different waste materials. The visual representation serves as a compelling reminder that materials often disposed of without much thought, including paper, have substantial contributions to energy conservation when recycled. This graph underscores the importance of holistic waste management practices, encouraging a mindful approach to recycling various materials to maximize overall energy savings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph indicates a strong relationship between a country’s population size and its total food waste, with an r^2 regression coefficient of approximately 0.966. This implies that 96.6% of the variability in a nation’s overall food waste can be accounted for by its population size. These results align precisely with my hypothesis that a country’s total food waste is influenced by its population size.\nTo conclude, if every individual takes responsibility and contributes to reducing food waste through recycling and mindful consumption, we have the power to make a significant impact.\nBy doing so, not only can we decrease the amount of food discarded, but we can also save substantial amounts of energy.\n\n\nIt’s a collective effort that holds the key to a more sustainable and energy-efficient future for our planet."
