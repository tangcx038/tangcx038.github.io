This journey, called the supply chain, uses a lot of the Earth's resources. When we sit down to eat, we get to enjoy the amazing result. Tradition and good cooking bring us tasty, nourishing, joyful, passionate, and life-giving meals. However, the sad truth is that we throw away a ton of our foodâ€”loads of it! And when we do that, we're also tossing away all the valuable resources that were essential to make it in the first place.</p>\n\n  <p>**WASTING FOOD IS WASTING AGRICULTURAL LAND.** The food produced but wasted globally every year requires 1.4 billion hectares of land, which is close to 30% of the world agricultural land area (UNEP, 2022).</p>\n\n  <p>**WASTING FOOD IS WASTING MONEY.** Besides its environmental cost, food wastage also represents a loss of economic value. On a global scale, the economic cost of the overall amount of food wastage is about $US 750 billion, equivalent to the GDP of Switzerland (FAO, 2011).</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"\" class=\"text-center fw-bold my-5\">Wondering how much <div class=\"foodwasteword\">food is wasted across the world?</div></h3>\n  <p>According to the **United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organisation of United Nation (FAO)**, an estimation of all the food produced every year for human consumption in the world, one-third does not reach our stomachs.</p>\n</section>\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
