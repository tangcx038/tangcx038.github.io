## {{< fa smile >}} Me.

I am currently a year3 undergraduate at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), pursuing a [Bachelor's in Arts in Archiecture](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/arch/programmes/bachelor-of-arts-in-architecture/) with a major in Architecture alongside a minor in [Interactive Media Development](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/cnm/undergraduate-minor-imd/). 

My passion lies in design and creativity. While my primary focus has been on architectural concepts and aesthetics, I am also enthusiastic about expanding my skill set to include coding and web development.

My goal is to acquire coding skills that will empower me to design and develop my own webpage. I am thrilled about the prospect of merging architectural design principles with interactive and user-friendly web interfaces.

Explore my website to discover more! Don't hesitate to reach out if you have opportunities for internships, learning experiences in webpage development, or positions in architecture firms, art studios, or any design-related fields. I'm eager to discuss potential collaborations and opportunities, and my [inbox](mailto:e0775098@u.nus.edu) is always open for exciting ventures in these domains.

## {{< fa gamepad >}} Hobbies.

I reside in the vibrant community of Raffles Hall. Sporting activities are a significant part of my routine, with badminton and table tennis being my go-to choices during leisure hours. Volunteering is another passion I pursue whenever time permits. Engaging in meaningful conversations and acquiring new knowledge bring me immense joy. Currently, I am delving into the world of animation creation using Procreate, and simultaneously, I'm exploring the art of webpage development through the NM2207 module.
