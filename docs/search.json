This journey, called the supply chain, uses a lot of the Earth’s resources. When we sit down to eat, we get to enjoy the amazing result. Tradition and good cooking bring us tasty, nourishing, joyful, passionate, and life-giving meals. However, the sad truth is that we throw away a ton of our food—loads of it! And when we do that, we’re also tossing away all the valuable resources that were essential to make it in the first place.\n\n\nWASTING FOOD IS WASTING AGRICULTURAL LAND. The food produced but wasted globally every year requires 1.4 billion hectares of land, which is close to 30% of the world agricultural land area (UNEP, 2022).\n\n\nWASTING FOOD IS CONTRIBUTING TO GLOBAL WARMING. The carbon footprint of food wasted globally every year is 3.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. If food waste was a country, it would be the third top emitter after the USA and China (FAO, 2011).\n\n\nWASTING FOOD IS WASTING MONEY. Besides its environmental cost, food wastage also represents a loss of economic value. On a global scale, the economic cost of the overall amount of food wastage is about $US 750 billion, equivalent to the GDP of Switzerland (FAO, 2011).\n\n\nHow much food is wasted?\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organisation of United Nation (FAO), an estimation of all the food produced every year for human consumption in the world, one-third does not reach our stomachs.\n\n\n\n## Libraries \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n\ncreateInteractiveMap &lt;- function(data_file, map_resolution = \"world\") {\n\n\n  # Import the data with coordinates\n  world_map &lt;- map_data(map_resolution)\n  accesstonet &lt;- read.csv(data_file)\n  map_data &lt;- accesstonet %&gt;% rename(region = country)\n\n  map &lt;- left_join(world_map, map_data, by = \"Country\")\n\n  # Create the ggplot object\n  gg &lt;- ggplot(map, aes(long, lat, group = group, text = paste(\"Country: \", country, \"&lt;br&gt;Annual Kg per Capita: \", FoodWaste2021kgcapitayear))) +\n    geom_polygon(aes(fill = FoodWaste2021kgcapitayear), color = \"white\", size = 0.03) +\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightgreen\", high = \"darkgreen\") +\n    theme_minimal()\n\n  # Convert ggplot to plotly\n  map_plotly &lt;- ggplotly(gg, tooltip = \"text\")\n\n  # Display the interactive map\n  return(map_plotly)\n}\n\n## Libraries \nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(plotly)\n\ncreateInteractiveMap &lt;- function(data_file, map_resolution = \"world\") {\n  # Import the data with coordinates\n  world_map &lt;- map_data(map_resolution)\n  accesstonet &lt;- read.csv(data_file)\n  map_data &lt;- accesstonet %&gt;% rename(region = country)\n\n  map &lt;- left_join(world_map, map_data, by = \"region\")\n\n  # Create the ggplot object\n  gg &lt;- ggplot(map, aes(long, lat, group = group, text = paste(\"Country: \", region, \"&lt;br&gt;Annual Kg per Capita: \", FoodWaste2021kgcapitayear))) +\n    geom_polygon(aes(fill = FoodWaste2021kgcapitayear), color = \"white\", size = 0.03) +\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightgreen\", high = \"darkgreen\") +\n    theme_minimal()\n\n  # Convert ggplot to plotly with specified width and height\n  map_plotly &lt;- ggplotly(gg, tooltip = \"text\", width = 1000, height = 600)\n\n  # Set scrollZoom to FALSE\n  map_plotly$x$layout$updatemenus &lt;- list(list(type = \"zoom\",\nshowactive = FALSE,\nbuttons = list(list(args = list(\"zoomType\", \"zoomin\"),\nlabel = \"Zoom In\",\nmethod = \"relayout\"),\nlist(args = list(\"zoomType\", \"zoomout\"),\nlabel = \"Zoom Out\",\nmethod = \"relayout\")),\ndirection = \"left\",\npad = list(r = 10, t = 87),\nshowactive = FALSE,\ntype = \"buttons\",\nx = 0.1,\ny = 1))\n\n  # Display the interactive map\n  return(map_plotly)\n}"
