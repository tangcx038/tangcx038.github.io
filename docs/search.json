Sporting activities are a significant part of my routine, with badminton and table tennis being my go-to choices during leisure hours. Volunteering is another passion I pursue whenever time permits. Engaging in meaningful conversations and acquiring new knowledge bring me immense joy. Currently, I am delving into the world of animation creation using Procreate, and simultaneously, I’m exploring the art of webpage development through the NM2207 module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Journey in Architecture with my professors and unrelenting supports from my peers and family members."

This journey, called the supply chain, uses a lot of the Earth’s resources. When we sit down to eat, we get to enjoy the amazing result. Tradition and good cooking bring us tasty, nourishing, joyful, passionate, and life-giving meals. However, the sad truth is that we throw away a ton of our food—loads of it! And when we do that, we’re also tossing away all the valuable resources that were essential to make it in the first place.\n\n\nWASTING FOOD IS WASTING AGRICULTURAL LAND. The food produced but wasted globally every year requires 1.4 billion hectares of land, which is close to 30% of the world agricultural land area (UNEP, 2022).\n\n\nWASTING FOOD IS WASTING MONEY. Besides its environmental cost, food wastage also represents a loss of economic value. On a global scale, the economic cost of the overall amount of food wastage is about $US 750 billion, equivalent to the GDP of Switzerland (FAO, 2011).\n\n\nWondering how much\n\nfood is wasted across the world?\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organisation of United Nation (FAO), an estimation of all the food produced every year for human consumption in the world, one-third does not reach our stomachs."
