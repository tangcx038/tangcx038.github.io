Sporting activities are a significant part of my routine, with badminton and table tennis being my go-to choices during leisure hours. Volunteering is another passion I pursue whenever time permits. Engaging in meaningful conversations and acquiring new knowledge bring me immense joy. Currently, I am delving into the world of animation creation using Procreate, and simultaneously, I'm exploring the art of webpage development through the NM2207 module.\n\n::: column-margin\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](StudioFR.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.extra-small-text .dark-gray-text .topbr}\nMy Journey in Architecture with my professors and unrelenting supports from my peers and family members.\n:::\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## {{< fa book >}} NM2207\n\nCheck out for my current NM2207 weekly progress:\n\n<https://github.com/tangcx038/NM2207_CHING>\n\n<https://github.com/tangcx038/tangcx038.github.io>\n",
