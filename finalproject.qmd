  <p>Food comes from a long journey, starting with the farmer and ending up in our homes. Tradition and good cooking bring us tasty, nourishing, joyful, passionate, and life-giving meals. However, the sad truth is that we throw away a ton of our food—loads of it! And when we do that, we're also tossing away all the valuable resources that were essential to make it in the first place.</p>


  <h3 id=\"\" class=\"text-center fw-bold my-5\">Wondering how much <div class=\"foodwasteword\">food is wasted across the world?</div></h3>
  <p>According to the **United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organisation of United Nation (FAO)**, an estimation of all the food produced every year for human consumption in the world, one-third does not reach our stomachs.</p>

  <p><p>A bit of information regarding this segment:
  NUS researchers are at the forefront of addressing Singapore's food waste challenges, with approximately 10% of total waste attributed to discarded food and a recycling rate of around 14%. Headed by Associate Professor Tong Yen Wah from NUS Faculty of Engineering's Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, a collaboration with Shanghai Jiao Tong University has led to the development of an innovative anaerobic digester system. This system efficiently converts food scraps into electrical energy, heat, and fertilizers, forming a self-sustaining cycle as the generated electricity and heat power the entire process.

Operating like a biochemical stomach, the anaerobic digester breaks down organic matter in an oxygen-free environment. Designed by Dr. Zhang Jingxin from NUS Environmental Research Institute (NERI), the system utilizes anaerobic micro-organisms to convert food waste into biogas, subsequently transformed into heat and electrical energy. The repurposed heat is used to produce hot water, maintaining the optimal temperature for digestion. Every component of the system, from sensors to ventilating fans, is powered by electricity generated within.

According to the team's calculations, one tonne of food waste can generate between 200 to 400 kilowatt-hours of electricity, contingent on waste composition. The anaerobic digester also yields nutrient-rich digestate, converting about 80% of fed food waste, which can be further processed into liquid fertilizers for agricultural use. </p>

This implies that 96.6% of the variability in a nation's overall food waste can be accounted for by its population size. These results align precisely with my hypothesis that a country's total food waste is influenced by its population size.

To conclude, **if every individual takes responsibility and contributes to reducing food waste through recycling and mindful consumption, we have the power to make a significant impact.**

By doing so, not only can we decrease the amount of food discarded, but we can also save substantial amounts of energy.
