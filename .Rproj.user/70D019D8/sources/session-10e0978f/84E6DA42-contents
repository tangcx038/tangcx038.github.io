# Self-Introduction

My name is Ching Xian. <span style="color: Green;">I am a Year 3 Architecture student with a passion for design and creativity.</span> While my main focus has been on architectural concepts and aesthetics, I am also eager to expand my skill set to include coding and web development.

My goal is to learn coding skills that will enable me to design and develop my own webpage. I am excited about the prospect of combining architectural design principles with interactive and user-friendly web interfaces.

I am looking forward to the learning journey and gaining insights from fellow enthusiasts and experts. Let's embark on this exciting adventure together! :)

## Curious how I created this?

Here's how I did it:

```{r, out.height= "500px", out.width= "1800px", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="Image 2: Using R Markdown and writing those code"}
knitr::include_graphics("Screenshot14-08-23.png")
```
```{r, out.height= "500px", out.width= "1800px", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="Image 3: Using R Markdown and writing those code"}
knitr::include_graphics("Screenshot(2)14-08-23.png")
```
and using similar code, I input this image:P

So coding can be more fun than it looks!! Excited and definitely looking forward to make my webpage even more fabulous!
