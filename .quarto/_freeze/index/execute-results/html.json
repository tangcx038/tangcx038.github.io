I am a Year 3 Architecture student with a passion for design and creativity. While my main focus has been on architectural concepts and aesthetics, I am also eager to expand my skill set to include coding and web development.\n\nMy goal is to learn coding skills that will enable me to design and develop my own webpage. I am excited about the prospect of combining architectural design principles with interactive and user-friendly web interfaces.\n\nI am looking forward to the learning journey and gaining insights from fellow enthusiasts and experts. Let's embark on this exciting adventure together! :)\n",
