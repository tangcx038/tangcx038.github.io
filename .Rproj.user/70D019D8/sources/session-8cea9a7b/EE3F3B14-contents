\# Self-Introduction

My name is Ching Xian. I am a Year 3 Architecture student with a passion for design and creativity. While my main focus has been on architectural concepts and aesthetics, I am also eager to expand my skill set to include coding and web development.

My goal is to learn coding skills that will enable me to design and develop my own webpage. I am excited about the prospect of combining architectural design principles with interactive and user-friendly web interfaces.

I am looking forward to the learning journey and gaining insights from fellow enthusiasts and experts. Let's embark on this exciting adventure together! :)
